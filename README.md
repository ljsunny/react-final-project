2. **Listening to Music**:

3. **Points System**:
   - Points are earned by listening to music. Users can spend their points to decorate their tree.

4. **Decorating the Tree**:
   - Users can spend their points on various items (tree decorations, backgrounds, etc.) to decorate their tree.

5. **Sharing**:
   - Users can share their decorated tree with others on social media or other platforms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è LocalStorage and JSON File Usage

### 1. `music.json` File

- Music data is stored in the `music.json` file, which the application loads to present a list of available music for users to listen to.
- The `music.json` file is located at `public/music.json`, and it follows this format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Zac Nelson - Merry Christmas",
    "artist": "Zac Nelson",
    "duration":149,
    "src": "/Music/Zac Nelson - Merry Christmas.mp3",
    "img":"/svg/album/default.jpg"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Wolf Samuels - We Wish You a Merry Christmas",
    "artist": "Wolf Samuels",
    "duration":96,
    "src": "/Music/Wolf Samuels - We Wish You a Merry Christmas.mp3",
    "img":"/svg/album/We-Wish-You-A-Merry-Christmas.jpg"
  },
]
```

### 2. Using LocalStorage

- When users log in, their session information is saved to LocalStorage.
- Points earned and tree data are also saved to LocalStorage, so data persists even if the application is closed or the page is refreshed.

### 3. Data Initialization

When the project runs, if `localStorage` doesn't contain any data, the application will set default data. For example, if there's no music data or points, it will initialize with the default values.
